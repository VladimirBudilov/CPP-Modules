# Welcome to My CPP Modules Repository!

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for dropping by my GitHub repository. Here, you'll find all the completed CPP Modules from my journey at 42 School. Before you dive in, there are a few things you should know:

## ⚠️ Warnings and Friendly Reminders

### 1. I'm New to C++, Please Be Kind 🙏

I'm just getting started with C++, so brace yourself for some interesting code! Mistakes are part of the learning process, and I'm cool with that. If you spot something that makes you raise an eyebrow or chuckle, feel free to:

- Open an issue to let me know what went wrong (I promise not to cry).
- Be a coding superhero and send a pull request with your improvements! 🦸‍♂️

### 2. Code Hygiene Might Be... Questionable 😅

I'll be honest; I'm still trying to figure out what "clean" and "nice" code looks like in C++. So, if you encounter some code that looks like it had a rough night out, remember:

- It's all part of the process. C++ can be a tricky beast, but we'll tame it together.
- If you have suggestions on how I can tidy things up, please share! Let's learn and grow together.

### 3. Brace Yourself for Some "Unique" Solutions 🤪

Sometimes, you might stumble upon solutions that seem a tad...overcomplicated. But hey, learning can be fun, right? So, if you're scratching your head, don't worry:

- It's just my quirky way of having fun while learning. Think of it as a puzzle!
- Feel free to simplify things if you'd like. I'm all for simplicity too.

## 🚀 Let's Learn and Laugh Together!

So, there you have it! Welcome to my CPP Modules repository. Let's embark on this C++ adventure together, learn from each other, and most importantly, have a good laugh along the way.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
